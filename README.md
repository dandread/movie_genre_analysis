# Initial Genre Recommendations for Microsoft
#### Author: Dominick D'Andrea

# Overview
Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio because they have recognized the success of other studios. However, they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry and explore what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

# Data
The data for this project comes from IMDB and TheMovieDB.org. There are several databases that needed to be joined from IMDB to connect each movie to its respective rating, which can be accomplished using a unique identifier for each movie. TheMovieDB.org contains the financial information for movies, but contains significantly less data that the IMDB database. Therefore, joining the two resulted in a smaller sbuset of movies that had financial and ratings information.

# Methods
This project uses exploratory data analysis to look at genre financial and ratings to come up with a recommendation.

# Results
The genre with the highest ROI is documentary, but it's important to consider the production budget and gross revenue (in this case, worldwide) for each genre. Documentaries may have the highest ROI, but they have the lowest gross revenue of all genres.

Looking one layer deeper, we see that production budgets have varied greatly over genres. Cross-referencing this information with genre ROI, Action and Comedy are attractive prospects. Action films have the second highest ROI of 111% and a median budget of $60 million and Comedy films have the fourth highest ROI of 92% with a median budget of $28 million.

Adventure, Animation, and Sci-Fi movies gross more, on average, with Animation bringing in a median of $100 million. However, the production budgets for these genres are unsurprisingly high, which would not be prudent to pursue so early in the game. Theses films require a lot of special effects and computer animations, which are expensive and take time to perfect. Comedy and Action films don't gross as much, but the potential for Action films to gross high amounts is there, looking at the distribution.

# Conclusions
I would recommend Microsoft pursue either Action or Comedy films given the ROI and relatively modest production costs. Their ratings are vitually identical at 6.4 and 6.2, respectively. Comedy is a more crowded space, whith over 25 thousand movies while there may be more opportunity to shine with an Action film, which has about 10 thousand films.

# Next Steps
I think it's important to consider whether or not Microsoft will focus on domestic or international movies, which could change the findings depending on what is popular in the US versus abroad. Further data analysis could also uncover any relationships between ROI and runtime/production budget. Once a genre is selected, a list of producers with the highest grossing movies and ratings in that genre should be constructed, as these could be potential collaborators or producers for Microsoft.
